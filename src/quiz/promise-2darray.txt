Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.


When sumPromise1 is created, sum2DArray is invoked with a valid 2D array, logging "Sum called ...".
 It sets a timeout and logs "returning from sum" after. 
For sumPromise2, when created with an invalid input, "rejecting ..." is logged promptly.

The setTimeout inside sum2DArray executes and calculates the sum. 
when completed, "resolving ..." is logged, and the promise resolves with the sum.
 If the input is invalid, the promise rejects with the corresponding error message.
